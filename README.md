# Basic Calculator
![Calculator Preview](Mycalculator-preview.jpg)

> A modern, responsive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring dark/light mode toggle and interactive 3D button effects.

## üìñ Project Overview

This is a feature-rich calculator web application created for practice purposes. It includes the four standard mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with additional functionality like percentage calculations, sign toggle, and clear operations. The project features a sleek, modern UI with a dark/light mode toggle and realistic 3D button press effects that simulate physical button interaction.

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è This project is created purely for educational purposes. The layout and style are designed by me on Figma, and the interface is built using **custom design** decisions to practice front-end development techniques.

## üì± Responsive Breakpoints

- **Desktop**: 600px+ (full feature set with hover effects)
- **Tablet**: 480px - 599px (adapted button sizes and spacing)
- **Mobile**: 375px - 479px (optimized for touch interaction)
- **Small Mobile**: <375px (compact layout with minimal margins)

## üîß Key Implementation Details

### Dynamic Button Creation
- Buttons are dynamically generated from arrays for maintainable code
- Each button type (numbers, operators, functions) has distinct styling
- Event listeners are attached programmatically for consistent behavior

### Theme Management
- localStorage integration for persistent dark/light mode preference
- Dynamic style application based on current theme
- Smooth transitions between theme changes

### 3D Button Effects
- Custom press animation that removes bottom border and translates button position
- Data attributes store original colors for proper restoration
- Mouse event handling for press/release/leave states
