> A simple, responsive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📖 Project Overview

This is a basic calculator web application created for practice purposes. It includes the four standard operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and is designed with a clean, modern UI. The project helps reinforce DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript, as well as responsive web design using Flexbox and media queries.

> ‼️ This project is created purely for educational purposes. The layout and style are created by me on figma, and the interface is built using **placeholder design** decisions to practice front-end development.
